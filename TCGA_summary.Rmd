# Cancer-specific analysis

## Analysis 2: Survival effect of `r selected_genes` in `r cancer` cancer

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis2/", selected_genes, "_", cancer, ".png"))
```

## Analysis 3: Survival effect of `r selected_genes` in specific clinical subtypes, `r cancer` cancer

The table lists clinical subtypes where the expression of `r selected_genes` in `r cancer` most significantly affects survival. The table is sorted by increasing p-values, most significant on top. Description of clinical subtypes can be found at [https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/data-harmonization-and-generation/clinical-data-harmonization](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/data-harmonization-and-generation/clinical-data-harmonization)

```{r}
global_stats <- read.table(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis3/global_stats.txt"), sep = "\t", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
global_stats <- global_stats[order(global_stats$p.value), ]
global_stats_subset <- global_stats[grepl(cancer, global_stats$Cancer, fixed = TRUE, ignore.case = FALSE), ]
rownames(global_stats_subset) <- NULL
global_stats_subset %>% head(., n = n_max) %>% kable
```

Top five corresponding survival plots

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
print(global_stats_subset$Cancer[1])
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis3/", selected_genes, "_", global_stats_subset$Cancer[1], ".png"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
print(global_stats_subset$Cancer[2])
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis3/", selected_genes, "_", global_stats_subset$Cancer[2], ".png"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
print(global_stats_subset$Cancer[3])
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis3/", selected_genes, "_", global_stats_subset$Cancer[3], ".png"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
print(global_stats_subset$Cancer[4])
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis3/", selected_genes, "_", global_stats_subset$Cancer[4], ".png"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
print(global_stats_subset$Cancer[5])
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis3/", selected_genes, "_", global_stats_subset$Cancer[5], ".png"))
```

## Analysis 5: Clinical-centric analysis. Selected cancer, selected clinical subcategory, selected_genes expression differences across categories

Expression of `r selected_genes` in selected clinical subcategories

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='250px'}
# 'PAM50Call_RNAseq' for BRCA, 'subtype' for OV
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis5/", cancer, "_", selected_genes, "_PAM50Call_RNAseq.png"))
```

What are the means of log2-expression per clinical subgroup?

```{r}
load(file = paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis5/mtx_to_plot.rda"))
tapply(mtx_to_plot$Gene, mtx_to_plot$Clinical, mean)
```

Is the expression of selected_genes `r selected_genes` significantly different across clinical subgroups? Significant "Pr(>F)" suggests "Yes"

```{r}
# ANOVA
groupdiff <- lm(mtx_to_plot$Gene ~ mtx_to_plot$Clinical)
# summary(groupdiff)
anova(groupdiff)
```

Which pair of clinical categories have significant differences? "p.adj" and confidence intervals that do not cross 0 suggest significant differences in selected_genes expression between the subgroups in the corresponding pairwise comparison. Tukey HSD (Honest Significant Difference) test

```{r}
# Tukey HSD
a1 <- aov(mtx_to_plot$Gene ~ mtx_to_plot$Clinical)
# summary(a1)
posthoc <- TukeyHSD(x=a1, 'mtx_to_plot$Clinical', conf.level=0.95)
posthoc <- posthoc$`mtx_to_plot$Clinical`
posthoc[order(posthoc[, "p adj"]), ] %>% pander()

# Differences in means plot
# par(las = 2)
# par(mar = c(5, 8, 5, 8))
# plot(posthoc)
```

Is there a survival difference between clinical subgroups?

```{r eval=TRUE}
global_stats <- read.table(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis5/global_stats.txt"), sep = "\t", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
global_stats <- global_stats[order(global_stats$p.value), c("Cancer", "Gene", "p.value", "HR")]
rownames(global_stats) <- NULL
pander(global_stats)
```

# Global analysis

## Analysis 2: Survival effect of `r selected_genes` in all cancers

The bar plot shows the significance of `r selected_genes` expression on survival in a given cancer. The wider (higher) the bar, the more significant survival effect the `r selected_genes` has. See abbreviations of cancer types at [http://www.liuzlab.org/TCGA2STAT/CancerDataChecklist.pdf](http://www.liuzlab.org/TCGA2STAT/CancerDataChecklist.pdf)   

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis2/", selected_genes, "_all_TCGA_cancers.png"))
```

The same data in table format. Legend: `Cancer`, `Cancer.Name` - cancer abbreviation and description; `Gene` - selected_genes name for which survival analysis was run; `p.value` - significance of the survival effect; `HR`, `HR_left`, `HR_right` - hazard ratio, and left/right confidence interval; `Min.`, `X1st.Qu.`, `Median`, `Mean`, `X3rd.Qu.`, `Max.` - expression level of the selected_genes in a corresponding cancer; `Cutoff_type`, `Cutoff_value` - selected_genes expression cutoff best discriminating survival

```{r}
cancers <- openxlsx::read.xlsx("data.TCGA/TCGA_cancers.xlsx")
mtx <- read.table(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis2/global_stats.txt"), sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
mtx <- mtx[order(mtx$p.value), ]
mtx <- left_join(mtx, cancers, by = c("Cancer" = "Acronym"))
mtx <- mtx[, c("Cancer", "Cancer.Name", "Gene", "p.value", "HR", "HR_left", "HR_right", "Min.", "X1st.Qu.", "Median", "Mean", "X3rd.Qu.", "Max.", "Cutoff_type", "Cutoff_value")]
# DT::datatable(mtx)
kable(mtx[1:min(nrow(mtx), n_max), ])
```

## Analysis 3: Survival effect of `r selected_genes` in specific clinical subtypes, all cancers

Top `r n_max` clinincal subtypes across all cancers where `r selected_genes` significantly (p-value < `r p_val_cutoff`) affects survival

```{r}
global_stats <- read.table(paste0(selected_genes, ".Analysis3/global_stats.txt"), sep = "\t", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
global_stats <- global_stats[order(global_stats$p.value), ]
rownames(global_stats) <- NULL
global_stats[global_stats$p.value < p_val_cutoff, ] %>% head(., n = n_max) %>% kable
```

## Analysis 3: Cancer-specific top clinical subtypes where `r selected_genes` significantly affects survival, for each cancer

Only results for cancers with clinical subtypes where `r selected_genes` significantly (p-value < `r p_val_cutoff`) affects survival are shown

```{r results="asis"}
all_cancers = c("ACC", "BLCA", "BRCA", "CESC", "CHOL", "COAD", "COADREAD", "DLBC", "ESCA", "GBM", "GBMLGG", "LGG", "HNSC", "KICH", "KIPAN", "KIRC", "KIRP", "LIHC", "LUAD", "LUSC", "MESO", "OV", "PAAD", "PCPG", "PRAD", "READ", "SARC", "SKCM", "STAD", "TGCT", "THCA", "THYM", "UCEC", "UCS")
for (cancer_selected in all_cancers) {
  global_stats_subset <- global_stats[grepl(paste0("^", cancer_selected, "-"), global_stats$Cancer, ignore.case = FALSE) & global_stats$p.value < p_val_cutoff, , drop = FALSE] 
  rownames(global_stats_subset) <- NULL
  if (nrow(global_stats_subset) > 0) {
    global_stats_subset %>% head(., n=n_max) %>% kable(., caption = cancers$Cancer.Name[cancers$Acronym == cancer_selected]) %>% print()
  }
}
```

## Analysis 3: Survival effect of `r selected_genes` in manually defined clinical subtypes, all cancers

```{r results="asis"}
# Add any subcategories to check if the gene affects survival in them in any cancer
clinical_subcategories <- c("race-black or african american", "race-white")
for (selected_clinical_subcategory in clinical_subcategories) {
  global_stats_subset <- global_stats[grepl(selected_clinical_subcategory, global_stats$Cancer) & global_stats$p.value < p_val_cutoff, ]
  rownames(global_stats_subset) <- NULL
  kable(global_stats_subset, caption = selected_clinical_subcategory) %>% print()

# Methods

## Survival analysis of selected_genes expression data from TCGA

Level 3 selected_genes expression data summarized as RSEM values were obtained using the `TCGA2STAT` R package v 1.2, along with the corresponding clinical annotations. Data for each of the 34 cancers were obtained separately. The data was log2-transformed and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard model. Each selected_genes of interest was analyzed for its effect on survival by separating patients into high/low expression subgroups. A modified approach from [@Mihaly:2013aa] was used to estimate the best selected_genes expression cutoff that separates high/low expression subgroups with differential survival.

We took advantage of the availability of clinical annotations. To identify if the expression of a selected_genes of interest affects survival in any specific clinical subgroup, subsets of patients annotated with specific clinical annotations were selected (e.g., “males” or “females” in the “gender” clinical annotation). Subgroups with < 40 patients were not considered.

## Differential expression analysis

Samples in the selected cancer cohort were sorted by expression of the selected genes. Differentially expressed genes were detected between samples in the upper 75 percentile of the expression gradient and samples in the lower 25 percentile using `limma` v 3.32.6 R package [@Ritchie:2015aa; @Smyth:2004aa]. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method [@Benjamini:1995aa]. Genes differentially expressed at FDR < 0.01 were selected for further analysis.
